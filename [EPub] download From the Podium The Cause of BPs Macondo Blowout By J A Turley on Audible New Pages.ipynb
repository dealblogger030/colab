A. (John) Turley--is a retired petroleum-engineering professor, drilling manager, and oil-and-gas executive. He wrote mysteries for ten years before BP's April 2010 Macondo blowout in the Gulf of Mexico, after which he fully committed his research and writing time to the real-world disaster.Looking for answers to an often-repeated question--"What happened to that rig in the Gulf?"--he studied publicly available depositions, well data, and investigative reports; ignored finger-pointing, pontificating attorneys, and hearsay evidence; and assessed the cause of the disaster from engineering, operations, and management perspectives. Defining the cause of the blowout and applying results to future wells became: (1) the subject of his widely acclaimed book, THE SIMPLE TRUTH: BP's Macondo Blowout, and (2) the basis for his professional speaking platform, with seventy-five presentations in eleven countries and across the US to operating companies, professional societies,  .</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"0font-family: Comic;\"><strong>Supporting format</strong>: <em>PDF, EPUB, Kindle, Audio, MOBI, HTML, RTF, TXT, etc.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"0font-family: Comic;\"><strong>Supporting</strong> : <em>PC, Android, Apple, Ipad, Iphone, etc.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"0font-family: Comic;\">================*================</span></p>",

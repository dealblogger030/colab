She is haunted by memories of being kidnapped and the savage attack that killed her best friend. Now Beth finally thinks she's ready to move on...with Braden Edwards, a charming, irresistibly sexy man who tempts Beth to embrace the present.But the past lurks closer than Beth realizes. Markko Bolvek, one of the werewolves who kidnapped her, has tracked her to Portland, Oregon, his pursuit fueled by a hunger for vengeance. Only Braden, a werewolf himself, senses the danger shadowing her steps. The Edwards and Bolveks have been enemies for centuries?and despite the instant connection he feels with Beth, Braden isn't sure which side of the war she's on.With suspicion at odds with their attraction, Beth and Braden must learn to trust one another to stop Markko for good. Can Beth accept the wolf within?and love a man who embodies everything she fears?</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>#bookish ,#kindleaddict ,#EpubForSale ,#bestbookreads ,#ebookworm ,#readyforit ,#downloadprint</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By click link in above! wish you have good luck and enjoy reading your book.</p><p>(Works on PC, Ipad, Android, iOS, Tablet, MAC)</p>",

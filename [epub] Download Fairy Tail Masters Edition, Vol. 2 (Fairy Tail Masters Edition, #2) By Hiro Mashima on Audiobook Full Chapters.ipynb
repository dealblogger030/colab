When she happens to meet one of Fairy Tail s top wizards, he turns out to be not quite what she expected: a slob traveling with a flying cat. But the promise of adventure is real, and together they escape from pirates and a devious magician! Their next task: to steal a book from the evil wizard-killing Duke Everlue, and outsmart his death trap. Eccentric new friends join along the way in this lushly-drawn modern classic, reissued from the beginning in a large size with a small price (for discerning guild masters). .</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive\"><strong>Supporting format</strong>: <em>PDF, EPUB, Kindle, Audio, MOBI, HTML, RTF, TXT, etc.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive\"><strong>Supporting</strong> : <em>PC, Android, Apple, Ipad, Iphone, etc.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive\">================*================</span></p>",

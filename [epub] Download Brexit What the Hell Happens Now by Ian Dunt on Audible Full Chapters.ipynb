Mishandling Brexit could lower our global status, diminish our quality of life, and throw our legal system into turmoil. With the help of leading experts in trade and law, Ian Dunt, editor of Politics.co.uk, explains:- why leaving the EU is set to make us permanently poorer- how cutting immigration will affect wages and taxes- why leading industries like farming, pharmaceuticals and finance will struggle to operate- whether the biggest constitutional change in post-war history will break up the UKThis is the first full public exploration of Brexit, shorn of the wishful thinking of its supporters in Parliament and the media.It is portrait of a country about to undergo a self-inflicted isolation. .</span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive\"><strong>Supporting format</strong>: <em>PDF, EPUB, Kindle, Audio, MOBI, HTML, RTF, TXT, etc.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive\"><strong>Supporting</strong> : <em>PC, Android, Apple, Ipad, Iphone, etc.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive\">================*================</span></p>",
